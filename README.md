Hi, I had trouble keeping track of my assignments last semester and looked around online for an assignment tracker that would allow me to simply write down assignments for a class. 
I could not find anything that did not have a subscription for it or something that was more complicated to use, so I created this for myself to just remember assignments for my classes and thought others might find it useful.
At the time it was only 4 fixed boxes, now I made it so people can add or remove as many classes/boxes they want and a little bit of customization.
The best use for this would be on a computer.
